The Cyclone Intensity Estimation System represents a significant advancement in meteorological technology, combining the
power of deep learning with the precision of INSAT-3D IR imagery. By providing accurate, real-time cyclone intensity
estimates, this system enhances the ability of meteorologists and disaster response teams to protect lives and property,
ensuring communities are better prepared for the impact of severe weather events

India is increasingly vulnerable area to the tropical cyclones, Especially the eastern side of the bay
of Bengal, where almost 3 cyclones make landfall annually and consequently claim thousands of
lives, disturbing agriculture and causing the infrastructural damage. Preciseness in anticipating
these cyclones is crucially important to prevent their loss of lives and material damages. Current
weather prediction models are very complicated and dependent on superior computational power
and a highly-skilled team of meteorologists are required for the accurate forecasts. According to
the above Situation our project is based on new deep learning approaches to identify the severity
of cyclones together with INSAT-3D infrared data (i.e IR Images Captured by INSAT Satillate).
Our model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network CNN that was trained on a large storm
database, which is composed of cyclones. The Principle mission of this project is to enhance
accuracy and promptness levels of real-time cyclone intensity prediction. Therefore, we will
contribute to the intensification of the disaster preparedness and response campaign, which in turn
will protect lives and prevent such calamities from causing serious socio-economic problems.
